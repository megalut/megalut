	"""
	This is a wrapper around galsim_adamom that meets the requirements of a MegaLUT-conform shape measurement function, namely
	to take only one catalog (astropy table) object containing -- or link to -- all the required data.
	In other words, this is a function that you could pass to meas.run.general() etc.
	If you want to combine several shape measurement algorithms into one shot, you would define such a function yourself (not here
	in megalut, but somewhere in your scripts).
	The present measfct serves as an example and is a bit long. It could be kept very short.
	
	:param catalog: an astropy table, which, in this case, is expected to have catalog.meta["img"] set
		to be a megalut.tools.imageinfo.ImageInfo object.
	:param runon: "img" or "psf" or other ImageInfo names to run on.
	:param kwargs: keyword arguments that will be passed to the lower-level measure() function.
		These set parameters of the shape measurement, but they do not pass any data.
		Do not try to specify "img" or "xname" here, it will fail! Set the catalog's meta["img"] instead.
		So for this particular measfct, you probably want to give at least stampsize as kwarg.

	Use the pixel positions provided via the 'catalog' input table to extract
	postage stamps from the image and measure their shape parameters.
	Returns a copy of your input catalog with the new (masked) columns appended.
