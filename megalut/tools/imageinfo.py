	"""
	Class to structure meta-data related to an image (stored in a FITS file) inside the meta dict of a catalog (astropy.table) object.
	Putting objects of this class in a catalogs's meta dict "links" an image file to that catalog.
	This way a catalog can have links to many images (galaxy stamps, PSF stamps, multiple exposures, filters...)
	
	When working with simple single-exposure images, the convention that shape measurement functions are asked to understand is that
	the galaxy stamp image is described in catalog.meta["img"], and (optionally) the PSF stamp image is in catalog.meta["psf"].
	We can derive a more sophisticated hierarchical structure when needed.
