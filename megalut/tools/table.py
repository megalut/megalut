	The present function is just a wrapper for one type of operation that is very
	frequently required when running MegaLUT.

	Instead of a simple hstack (which would rely on the order of rows), here we use 
	join to match the rows, using the idcol (i.e., "ID") column.
	We guarantee that the ouput table will have the same number of
	rows as the input tables.

	This function computes simple statistics "across" corresponding columns from the list of input catalogs (incats).
	
	:param incats: list of input catalogs (astropy tables, usually masked).
		They must all have identical order and column names (this will be checked).
	:param groupcols: list of column names that should be "grouped", that is the columns whose content differ from incat to incat.
	:param removecols: list of column names that should be discarded in the output catalog
	:param removereas: if True, the individual realization columns in the output table will **not** be kept in the ouput
		(except maybe the first one, see keepfirstreas).
		Setting this to False can result in very bulky catalogs.
	:param keepfirstreas: if True, the values of the first realization ("_0") will be kept.
		It is usually handy (and not too bulky) to "keep" one single realization in the output catalog.
	:param checkcommon: if True (default), the function tests that **any column which is not in groupcols or removecols is indeed IDENTICAL among the incats**.
		This can lead to perfomance issues for catalogs with many (say > 1000) columns.
	
	For each colname in groupcols, the function computes:
	
	- **colname_mean**: the average of colname from the different incats (skipping masked measurements)
	- **colname_med**: the median (idem)
	- **colname_std**: the sample standard deviation (idem)
	- **colname_n**: the number of available (that is, unmasked) measurements
	
	The function returns a single catalog, and the above column names designate the new columns that will be added to this catalog.
	
	.. note:: The number of incats (which is the maximum possible value for "colname_n") is stored as meta["ngroupstats"]
		of each of the newly created columns.	
		When running on measurements obtained on different realizations, this "ngroupstats" allows for instance to compute
		the success fraction of the measurement:  outcat["foo_n"] / outcat["foo_n"].meta["ngroupstats"]  
		
	Developer note: it is slow to append columns to astropy tables (as this makes a copy of the full table).
		So we try to avoid this as much as possible here, and use masked numpy arrays and hstack.
